### CNS_Image_Classification

This project is based on [Deep Learning for Cellular Image Analysis](https://github.com/umesh-gattem/CNS_Image_Classification/blob/main/research%20paper/Deep%20learning%20for%20cellular%20image%20analysis.pdf) Paper which is used to classify the human organs.

### Installation Process

You can clone the git repository since it is public repository. You can create a wheel distribution of the project by running following command

```python
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```

The above command generate wheel file in dist folder. You can install that whl file using following command.

```python
pip3 install {whl_file_path}
```

### Required Libraries

Go through the requirements.txt file for the libraries used in this project.You can install all libraries using following command.

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Structure

This project contains the notebook files which have code for image_classification problem given in the paper and respective python files. I have also pushed the [summary](https://github.com/umesh-gattem/CNS_Image_Classification/blob/main/research%20paper/DL%20for%20Cellular%20Image%20Analysis%20Summary.pdf) of the research paper.
I couldn't able to push data since it is huge. So all the notebook files and python read the data from this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m-rYzhWbabhVBEMbClq6fRoOpLUgpFnx) using the google colab.
